# Changes Report

## OOP Implementation
We have refactored the server logic to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This includes extracting logic into dedicated classes and creating a new server entry point.

### New Files
1.  **server/classes/DeviceManager.js**: Handles all CRUD operations for connected devices.
2.  **server/classes/WifiManager.js**: Manages WiFi configuration settings.
3.  **server/classes/TrafficMonitor.js**: Handles real-time traffic simulation and Socket.IO events.
4.  **server/oop_server.js**: A new entry point class `RouterServer` that composes the above classes to run the server.
5.  **OOP_Code_Summary.md**: A summary markdown file containing all the source code for the new OOP implementation.

### Usage
To run the server with the new OOP structure:
`node server/oop_server.js`

The original `server/index.js` remains untouched and can still be used.
